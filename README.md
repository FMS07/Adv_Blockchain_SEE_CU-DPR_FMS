# Crowdfunding project
## Description

This Repo has the files used to build our Crowdfunding prject.
* The contract used- Crowfundingfms.sol (present in the contracts folder)
* The front end - index.js (present in pages folder)
* The backend - deploy.js(present in scripts folder)

## Methods used:
For the Crowdfunding project, the .sol file involves 
four main functions: to create a campaign, to donate 
to a campaign, to get a particular campaign detail 
and to display all existing campaigns. 

1. Create the Campaign: This will enable the user 
to create a new crowdfunding campaign. Details of 
the target fundraise, duration of the campaign, and a 
description of the project or cause for which the 
money is being raised can be defined.

3. Donate to a Campaign: Users can make use of 
this function to contribute funds toward a particular 
campaign. They can mention the amount they would 
like to donate and can execute the transaction 
through the DApp.

4. Get a Particular Campaign Detail: This 
function fetches the details of a particular campaign. 
The user can find out the amount raised so far, the 
amount set for fundraising, and even the campaign 
status, among others.

5. Display All Campaigns: This function will 
display the listing of all active campaigns on the 
crowdfunding platform. Users can browse through 
the list to discover new campaigns to support or get 
an overview of fundraising activities on the 
platform.

### Note: The detailed explanation of the functions and the code is given in the report which also has images for our output and testing as well. This Github repo contains only the codes along with the dependencies used.
