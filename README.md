and to display all existing campaigns. 
1. Create the Campaign: This will enable the user 
to create a new crowdfunding campaign. Details of 
the target fundraise, duration of the campaign, and a 
description of the project or cause for which the 
money is being raised can be defined. 
2. Donate to a Campaign: Users can make use of
